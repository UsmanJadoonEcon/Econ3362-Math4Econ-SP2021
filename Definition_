Function: from a set "A" to a set "B" is a rule that assigns to each object in "A", 
one and only one object in "B". 

Domain: if function A approaches B, the set "A" of elements on which "f" is defined is called the "domain" of the function "f", 
the set "B" in which "f" takes its value is called the "target or target space" of "f".
