When money is allocated to firms, where does that money go?

Process of FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION:

(0) Money is borrowed from given Bank.
(1) The firm now has to maximize capital (as well as labor).

When analyzing firms, utilize the: PROFIT FUNCTION

This function, PROFIT FUNCTION, has two components to it: COST and REVENUE .
The PROFIT FUNCTION is denotated by "pi" π .

Production Function: Y(K) = A * K^α  or  Output(K) A * K^α
Where in A is the productivity term, if analyzing, then: is Firm A1 more productive than Firm A2 ?

If α = 1 , Y = A * K is Constant Retruns to Scale
If α < 1, Y = A * K^α is Decreasing Returns to Scale - as K increases - Y increases
if α

Output: "Y"
Output of Capital: "Y(K)"
Productivity Term: "A"
Given Parameter: "α" / "Grecian letter A"
With respect to: "W.R.T"
Price: "P"
Interest rate to borrow money from bank: "r"
Marginal product of capital: "MPK"
Revenue: "REV"
Profit Function: "π" / "Grecian letter: Pi" / (noted value approximately 3.14)

Objective: Max K / maximize capital 

Elasticity: % change in one economic variable in response to a change in another. EX: % change in demand given some % increase in price.
Returns to scale: quantitative change in output of a firm or industry resulting from a proportionate increase in all inputs. (constant, decreasing, increasing)
Marginal product: change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input. 

Derivative: a measure of velocity, positive velocity indicates increasing speed. rate at which the value y of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable x. 
Exponent: number indicating how many times to use that number in a multiplication. written above and to the right of a mathematical expression called the base
Logarithm: tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation. useful in multiplying / dividing large numbers.
